## Understanding Dice Rolls

When you attempt something risky, you'll roll dice:

- **Strong Hit** ✅ - You succeed! Things go your way.
- **Weak Hit** ⚠️ - You succeed, but there's a cost or complication.
- **Miss** ❌ - Things go wrong. The GM introduces a consequence.

## Tips for New Players

1. **Be descriptive** - "I search the cargo hold for clues" works better than "I search"
2. **Embrace failure** - Misses create interesting stories!
3. **Use the recap** - If you forget where you were, the recap helps
4. **Save often** - The auto-save is great, but manual saves before big decisions help
5. **Experiment** - Try different approaches to situations

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Session not found" error
Restart the game - sessions reset when the server restarts.

### Images not loading
API rate limits may be in effect. The game still works without images.

### Game feels slow
The AI is thinking! Complex actions take longer to generate.
