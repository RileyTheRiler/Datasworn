# Seven Key Structure Steps: The Mirror’s Edge

This document details the causal chain of the narrative, mapped backward from the ending to ensure every step forces change and aligns with the designing principle: **"The Investigation is a Mirror."**

## 1. Final Self-Revelation & New Equilibrium
*   **Final Self-Revelation:** "I am not the law that judges; I am the mirror that must be clean to see the truth."
*   **New Equilibrium:**
    *   The low hum of the ship's reactor is finally rhythmic, not ragged. You sit in the mess hall with a bowl of warm protein-mash, watching the sun of The Forge rise through the reinforced glass.
    *   The crew moves around you with ease, no longer tensed for a blow.
    *   You aren't checking the sensor logs for shadows anymore; the silence of the ship is peaceful, not heavy.

## 2. Initial Needs
*   **Psychological Need:** To maintain technical perfection and rigid protocol as a shield to distract from the suppressed memory of a past failure.
*   **Moral Need:** To label others as "broken" or "guilty" to maintain the illusion of one's own wholeness and moral superiority.
*   **Early On-Page Behavior:**
    *   *Need Proof:* You correct a junior officer's minor log formatting error with excessive, icy coldness during a crisis, ignoring their clear exhaustion.
    *   *Need Proof:* You dismiss Dr. Okonkwo's concern about crew mental health as "irrelevant to the data," choosing to focus on a minor sensor ghost instead of the person standing in front of you.

## 3. External Desire
*   **Goal:** Identify Captain Reyes's killer and secure the *Exile Gambit* for the corporation.
*   **Stakes (Measurable):** Secure the "Full Closure" report and the promotion that comes with it.
*   **Failure Consequence:** If not achieved, the ship enters a terminal death-spiral of paranoia, the corporation initiates a "total loss" protocol (scuttling the ship), and your own history of negligence is exposed by the subsequent auditors.

## 4. The Necessary Opponent
*   **Opponent:** **Yuki** (The Shadow Mirror).
*   **Shared Goal:** Total control over the narrative of what happened on the *Exile Gambit*.
*   **Method of Attack:** Yuki uses the ship's mechanical decay and the crew's human vulnerabilities to force you into situations where "procedure" is impossible. She attacks your core weakness—reliance on cold logic—by making the emotional cost of the "logical" choice unbearable.

## 5. Evolving Plan & Climax
*   **Strategic Shift 1:** Procedure fails. When the evidence logs are sabotaged/purged by the killer, you must abandon the "official" investigative path and engage in high-stakes emotional interrogation, risking your own psychological stability.
*   **Strategic Shift 2:** The "Self as Bait" Mirror. You realize the killer reacts to your own pattern of avoidance. You deliberately admit your own "broken" status and past failure to the crew/killer, using your vulnerability as the only mirror that can catch the truth.
*   **Climax:**
    *   **Setting:** The venting Engineering Deck, filled with steam and flashing red alarms.
    *   **Constraint:** You have 60 seconds of breathable air.
    *   **The Choice:** Catch Yuki as she flees (securing the "Truth" for the Corp) OR vent the reactor to save the crew trapped in the neighboring pod (securing the "People").

## 6. Validation against Premise & Principle
*   **Premise:** A detective running from their wounds investigates a murder and finds a mirror of their flaw.
*   **Validation:** 
    *   Step 1 (Revelation) completes the "Mirror" arc.
    *   Step 2 (Needs) establishes the "running from wounds."
    *   Step 4 (Opponent) ensures the conflict is internal and ironic.
    *   Step 5 (Climax) forces the change from "Procedure/System" to "People/Connection."
