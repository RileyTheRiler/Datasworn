# Psychological Systems - Player Guide

## Welcome to Your Mind

Your character in Starforged isn't just a collection of stats—they're a living, breathing person with a psyche that evolves, breaks, and heals over time. This guide explains how your mental state affects gameplay.

## Core Mechanics

### Stress (0-100%)
**What it is**: Mental and emotional pressure from danger, failure, and difficult choices.

**Effects**:
- **70%+**: Heartbeat sound effect, -1 penalty to Heart rolls
- **90%+**: Breaking Point risk—you might gain a Trauma Scar

**How to manage**: Use coping mechanisms, succeed at moves, rest

### Sanity (0-100%)
**What it is**: Your grip on reality and mental stability.

**Effects**:
- **<30%**: Hallucinations appear in the narrative, whispers play, -1 penalty to Wits rolls
- **<15%**: Static interference, chromatic aberration visual effects
- **0%**: **PERMADEATH** - Character is permanently lost

**How to manage**: Avoid trauma, complete therapy sessions, maintain relationships

### Emotion
Your current emotional state affects available dialogue options and NPC reactions.

**States**: Neutral, Hopeful, Afraid, Angry, Guilty, Suspicious, Overwhelmed, Peaceful, Resentful

## Trauma Scars

### What Are They?
Permanent psychological wounds acquired when stress hits 90%+. They modify your traits and change how you interact with the world.

### Types
- **Shattered Trust**: Paranoia increases, empathy decreases
- **Cold Logic**: Logic increases, empathy decreases  
- **Jittery Nerves**: Caution increases, resilience decreases
- **Survivor's Guilt**, **Paranoid Delusion**, **Emotional Shutdown**, and 4 more...

### Evolution Arc
Trauma scars evolve through therapy:
1. **Fresh** (0-9 sessions): Raw, painful
2. **Healing** (10-19 sessions): Beginning to transform
3. **Scarred** (20-29 sessions): Integrated but permanent
4. **Integrated** (30+ sessions): Transformed into wisdom

**Example**: "Shattered Trust" → "Cautious Trust" → "Guarded Openness" → "Wise Discernment"

## Coping Mechanisms

### How to Use
When stressed, you can attempt a coping mechanism. Roll to determine success.

### Available Mechanisms

| Mechanism | Stress Reduction | Side Effects |
|---|---|---|
| **Meditate** | -20% | Isolation risk after 5+ uses |
| **Journal** | -15% | None |
| **Vent to Crew** | -25% | Reveals vulnerability, requires NPC |
| **Exercise** | -18% | None |
| **Art Therapy** | -20% | Requires time/materials |
| **Prayer/Ritual** | -22% | None |
| **Stim Injection** | -40% | **Addiction risk**, -10% sanity |
| **Substance Abuse** | -35% | **Severe addiction**, -15% sanity |
| **Self-Isolation** | -25% | Severe isolation penalty |

### ⚠️ Addiction Warning
Using Stim Injection or Substance Abuse 3+ times creates addiction:
- **Withdrawal Penalty**: -1 to all rolls when not using
- **Severe Addiction** (8+ uses): -2 penalty

### ⚠️ Isolation Warning
Using Meditate or Self-Isolation 5+ times creates isolation:
- Social dialogue options become locked
- NPCs become distant

## Therapy & Healing

### How It Works
Visit Dr. Chen (the Medic) for therapy sessions. Each session:
1. Reduces trauma scar intensity by ~10%
2. Counts toward arc evolution
3. May transform the scar at milestones (10, 20, 30 sessions)

### Therapy is Slow
Healing trauma takes time. Plan for 10-30 sessions to fully integrate a scar.

---

## Difficulty Scaling

### How It Works
The game gets harder as you accumulate trauma:
- **Each Trauma Scar**: +10% difficulty
- **Low Sanity**: Up to +20% difficulty
- **Addiction**: Up to +20% difficulty

**Example**: 3 scars + 50% sanity + addiction = +50% harder game

---

## Permadeath Conditions

Your character can be permanently lost if:
1. **Sanity reaches 0%**
2. **5+ unintegrated (fresh) trauma scars**

**This is irreversible.** Manage your mental health carefully.

---

## Tips for Survival

1. **Don't ignore stress** - Use coping mechanisms before hitting 90%
2. **Avoid stims** - The short-term relief isn't worth addiction
3. **Seek therapy early** - Don't wait for scars to pile up
4. **Build relationships** - Venting to crew is powerful
5. **Know your limits** - Sometimes retreat is the right choice

---

## NPCs Remember

Crew members track your emotional outbursts. If you have a panic attack in the med bay, Dr. Chen will remember and reference it later. Your relationships evolve based on your mental state.

**Remember**: Your character's mind is as important as their body. Treat it with care.
